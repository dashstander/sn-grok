    "If $\\rho$ is an _irreducible_ representation of a group $G$ that isn't the trivial representation, then as a consequence of [Schur's Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur%27s_lemma#Corollary_of_Schur's_Lemma):\n",

    "This remains true for a subgroup $H \\le G$ if the [restricted representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_representation) $\\rho|_{H}$ remains irreducible with respect to $H$. If the it is no longer irreducible, however, then there will be some value left over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $S^{i}_{4}$ be the copy of $S_4 \\subset S_5$ that fixes $i$ and in particular consider $S^{5}_{4}$. For every irrep besides the one corresponding to $(2, 1, 1, 1)$ (and the trivial), $\\sum_{g \\in S^{5}_{4}} \\rho(g) = \\mathbf{0}$. However, for $(2, 1, 1, 1)$:\n",

    "This is because  $\\rho_{(2, 1, 1, 1)}$ splits when restricted to $S_4$, and in particular \n",

    "There are five copies of $S_4$ in $S_5$ and they are all conjugate. In particular, if $g \\in S^{5}_{4}$ and $(i, 5)$ is the transposition that swaps $i$ and $5$, then $g \\mapsto (i, 5)g(i, 5)$ takes $S^{5}_{4}$ to $S^{i}_{4}$. \n",

    "## Cosets\n",
    "\n",
    "The left and right cosets of $S_{n-1} \\subset S_n$ are interpretable. $S^{1}_{4}$ is all of the permutations of $S_5$ that fix 1, i.e. where 1 remains in the first position. Then there are five left cosets $gS^{1}_{4}$ that split up $S_{5}$. The cosets are mutually disjoint but the union of all of them equals $S_5$. The same is true of the five right cosets $S^{1}_{4}g$.\n",

    "The left cosets of $S^{1}_{4}$ are all of the permutations where $1$ is in a particular position, e.g. $\\{[2, 1, 3, 4, 5], [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [4, 1, 2, 3, 5], \\ldots \\}$ is one coset and $\\{[2, 3, 1, 4, 5], [3, 2, 1, 4, 5], [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], \\ldots \\}$ is another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The right cosets of $S^{1}_{4}$, on the other hand, are all of the permutations where a particular value are in the first position. So $\\{[2, 1, 3, 4, 5], [2, 3, 1, 4, 5], \\ldots \\}$ would be one coset and all the permutations where $5$ is first would be another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This means in particular that $\\{[2, 1, 3, 4, 5], [2, 3, 1, 4, 5], \\ldots \\}$ where $2$ is in the first position is a right coset of $S^{1}_{4}$ and a left coset of $S^{2}_{4}$."
